# do-i-know-this-artist

#### If you're just like me and use Youtube for all your music needs by creating playlists for different genres of music, this app will come in handy.

Let's say you look at a festival line-up and some artist's name sounds familiar, but you're not quite sure. Just open the app, type the name of the artist and see if you've saved tracks from that artist in one of your playlist !

OR

You have a song in mind and you want to listen to it. Some while ago, you found a HQ version of it on Youtube and you saved it into a playlist, but you're not quite sure what playlist ? Open the app, type in the artist or the track name and you'll find immediatly in which playlists it is saved.


Disclaimer :-) : 

Some tracks / artists will not be found because youtube's search api function is quite bad. 

For example, type 'georg' and it will not return anything.
